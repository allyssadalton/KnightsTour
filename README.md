**Overview**

The Knight’s Tour is a C++ project that solves the classic chessboard problem: moving a knight to every square on the board exactly once. The program applies backtracking and recursive search to generate valid tours and demonstrates algorithmic problem solving.

**Key Features**

Solves the Knight’s Tour on an N×N chessboard

Uses backtracking to explore possible moves

Supports both closed tours (ending where started) and open tours

Outputs the complete sequence of moves

**Skills Demonstrated**

Recursive algorithms & backtracking

C++ array and matrix manipulation

Combinatorial problem solving

Clean, modular implementation of search problems

Future Improvements

Visualization of moves in a GUI

Heuristic optimizations (e.g., Warnsdorff’s rule) for faster solving

Support for larger board sizes
